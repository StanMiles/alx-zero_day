my first readme
This repository is a mile stone in my resolve to do "hard things". Working on this project has been a roller-coaster of emotions! One moment I am jubilating my checker marked green the next I am furstrated AF and just want to cry! lol
I want to use this medium to document how I feel right now for you, yes future StanMiles reading this.. I did not freaking give up just to get you where you are! You owe me and future you! so wear your big boy pants and fcking engage with the challenges!!
